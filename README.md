# Improve my code!

I have used code from Pat to generate random control data for my neutral model. The code is found in `CopyOfneutral_time_course_Pat.R`. There are two data files you will need as well which are also in this repo. Clone the repo and work in teams to figure out how to make lines 29-44 more efficient, perhaps using `apply` or `map`. 

I will walk through each line of the code before we get started so you can get a general idea of what's going on. 

The rationale for this exercise is that I am guilty of using nested `for` loops in my analyses and then moving on without thinking of ways to make the process more efficient. I don't have a solution for this exercise, rather I am interested to see what the groups come up with (and I'll be joining a group!)

We'll do 10 minutes of intro, 20-25 minutes of coding and then 10-15 of sharing of our approaches. 

If you finish lines 29-47 early, see if you can find a more efficient way to do 53-64!
